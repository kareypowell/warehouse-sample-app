# Play for Java - Warehouse Sample App

Play for Java shows you how to build Java-based web applications using the Play 2 framework.
The book starts by introducing Play through a comprehensive overview example. Then, you'll
look at each facet of a typical Play application, both by exploring simple code snippets and
by adding to a larger running example. Along the way, you'll contrast Play and JEE patterns
and learn how a stateless web application can fit seamlessly in an enterprise environment.
